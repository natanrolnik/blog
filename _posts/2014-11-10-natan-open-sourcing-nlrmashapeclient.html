<p>Last week I needed to build a component from an app that uses an API available at <a href="http://mashape.com" target="_blank">Mashape</a>. When I looked into the documentation they provide, they suggest you to use <a href="http://unirest.io/objective-c" target="_blank">Unirest</a>: an open-source set of HTTP request libraries by Mashape itself. As as someone extremely addicted to AFNetworking, I found it a bit strange not to use one of the biggest trends in the iOS world. As I love the implementation and the concepts of AFNetworking (serializers, http managers, completion and failure blocks, and more), I thought that could be a great opportunity to make something more people could use.</p>
<p><a title="NLRMashapeClient at GitHub" href="http://www.github.com/natanrolnik/NLRMashapeClient" target="_blank">So NLRMashapeClient was born, and it's available on GitHub</a>. Follow the ReadME for instructions on how to implement (of course, it supports CocoaPods) in your app. Pull Requests are welcome!</p>
