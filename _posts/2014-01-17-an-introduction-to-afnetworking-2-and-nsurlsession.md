This week, I had the opportunity to present to my friends at work about AFNetworking 2. As it is full of new stuff, and, most important, supports the new networking foundation APIs on iOS and OS X - NSURLSession - it was a great opportunity for me to learn more into deep about this new APIs that I first heard about last June, at WWDC 2013.
So I decided to do a overview of NSURLConnection, AFNetworking 1, NSURLSession, and AFNetworking 2, and include all this in a presentation.
