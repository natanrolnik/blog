<p>This was my first app. In December 2009 I decided to try doing an app (something that mixes some of my hobbies: design, coding, User Interfaces, and more...) for a very important and basic book in Jewish culture. So I looked for sponsors, and ran for it!</p>
<p><strong>Thanks God, this app changed my whole life.</strong></p>
<p>It took me almost a month to understand how UITabBarContoller, UITableViews, UIWebViews, and UINavigationController works, in order to make the first Jewish app in Portuguese (also available in English, Spanish and French).</p>
<p>It's free, here:</p>
