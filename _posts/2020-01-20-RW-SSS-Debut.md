A few months ago, RayWenderlich.com launched a Server Side Swift section and they were looking for authors to join the team. As I believe that Swift on the server has a promising future - and not only amongst iOS developers - I decided to apply.

After many weeks of effort and with the support of their great team (tech editors, editors, designers), the tutorial went live earlier this month and I couldn't be more proud. I've been consuming content from RayWenderlich.com since 2013, be them tutorials, books and video courses. Joining their team is a dream coming true.

In this tutorial, the reader will learn how to build an SMS user authentication API using [Vapor](https://vapor.codes) and Amazon's AWS Simple Notification Service, SNS. Amongst the covered topics, are:

* How models work in Fluent and Vapor;
* How to register and use a protocol-based `Service` in Vapor;
* Token-based session authentication in Vapor;
* Registering routes in your server's API;
* Using the AWS swift package, requesting SNS to send the SMS in your behalf;
