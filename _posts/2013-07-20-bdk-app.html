<p>Finding Kosher products in Brazil was not as easy as in USA or Israel.</p>
<p>You needed to always walk with a little book (that had a list of more than 1,500 products), and find the product in. Ah, the list gets updated every week, and every 6 months a new book is published...</p>
<p>Now, it's in people's pocket. Brazil’s Kosher list, always updated, easy and fast to search for a product.</p>
<p>Core Data and AFNetworking are the core of this app!</p>
