<p>Imagine 12 years ago, when the most advanced mobile phones were those flip phones, the advanced ones with voice recognition and some of them even with color displays. I remember when I needed to write an essay for High School about technology...</p>
<h2>We are living in "The Future"</h2>
<p>Watch, Siri, home automation. Noach, machresha. The purpose of technology, but it doesn't work if we don't look over it.</p>
<h2>Question your habits in today's World</h2>
<ol>
<li>Wake up and check the phone</li>
<li>Read/Send messages while talking to someone, and ignoring or not being able to understand what they say</li>
<li>Are you adding something to people's lives when you share a photo on FB/Instagram? Have you ever thought if your friends want to see what you are eating for breakfast?</li>
<li>Bragging</li>
<li>Prayer concentration</li>
</ol>
<h2>What can wait Vs. What cannot</h2>
<h2>The subtle tap in your wrist</h2>
<h2>Never forget the priorities</h2>
<p>It doesn't matter which platform, device, brand you choose. Just keep in mind why we use all this.</p>
